## Summary
* Patient-specific CFD models allow deep investigation into patient physiology/pathology
  * Requires accurate BCs which may need to be measured invasively
  * In reality, coronary arteries have dynamic vessel motion due to elasticity
    * Computational hemodynamics solutions differ between rigid and elastic wall simulations
  * WSS commonly used metric
    * Associated with development/progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaques, vessel remodeling
    * WSS increased in regions where blood flow disrupted (bifurcations, highly curved vessels)
  * Goal: explore differences in WSS for rigid and elastic walls using patient-specific CFD studies
* CFD model details
  * Models of ascending aorta and coronary arteries constructed from patients with moderate stenosis
  * Physiologic BCs
    * Inlet: custom aortic flow rate waveform generated by scaling generic waveform to patient's cardiac output (CO) and heart rate (HR)
      * [Vascular Model Repository](http://www.vascularmodel.com/sandbox/doku.php)
    * Outlet aortic: Windkessel RCR
    * Outlet coronary: Modified lumped parameter model
    * Coronary and aortic resistances tuned such that total coronary flow ~4% of total CO
      * Individual resistances of coronary outlets inversely proportional to outlet area
      * Capacitance values match previously found values
  * Solved using SimVascular
    * Fluid-structure interaction wall modeling with the coupled momentum method (CMM-FSI) [Figueroa et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004578250500513X)
* High WSS at luminal narrowing regions and low WSS at regions immediately after stenoses
* Overall, differences between rigid and elastic wall TAWSS negligible
  * Differences between rigid and elastic wall explained by differences in speed of flow and pressure waves generated by wall deformation
