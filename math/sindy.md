## Summary
* Discovery of the governing equations for a dynamical system purely from data a long-sought goal in physics
  * Must balance model complexity (fewer terms) and accuracy (overfitting)
* Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)
  * Key insight/assumption: many systems governed by only a few functions ("sparse in the space of possible functions")
